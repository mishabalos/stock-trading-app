# STOCK TRADING APP IN RUBY ON RAILS

#### A stock trading web application that allows traders to create and manage their investment portfolios by buying and selling stocks, while admins oversee trader registrations, approvals, and transaction monitoring.

### OBJECTIVE
A Stock trading app created by Ruby on Rails

### SCENARIO FOR TRADER
The user is an aspiring stock trader who wants to buy and sell stocks using the application. They start by signing up and providing their details. After submitting their registration, they receive a confirmation email indicating that their application is pending approval. Once their account is approved, they receive another email notifying them that they can now trade.
After logging in, the trader explores the app’s stock market offerings. They buy stocks to build their investment portfolio, which they can view on the My Portfolio page. The Transactions page allows them to track all their stock purchases and sales in real time. When they decide to sell a stock, they execute the sale to gain money, with the transaction immediately reflecting in their portfolio and transaction history.

### SCENARIO FOR ADMIN
The admin is responsible for managing traders and overseeing stock transactions within the application. They have access to a dashboard that displays all registered traders, including pending signups. When a new trader registers, the admin reviews their application on the Pending Trader Signups page and approves or rejects it.
The admin can manually add new traders, update trader details, and view a trader’s complete profile, including their investments and transaction history. They also have access to a Transactions Monitoring page, where they can track all stock purchases and sales made by traders to ensure smooth financial operations within the app.
